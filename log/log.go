// Package log is the minimum an edge app must report to be operable.
//
// The rule it enforces: no response of 400 or worse leaves the Worker without a line
// saying why. A bare status code in a dashboard tells the operator that something broke,
// never what — and at the edge there is no shell to go and look.
//
// It is deliberately small. Successful requests are NOT logged: Cloudflare already records
// every request with its method, path and status, so an access log here would only
// duplicate it, cost CPU on the hot path and bury the lines that matter.
//
// Never pass a request body, a header or a cookie to these functions. Logs are read by
// people and shipped to third parties; a body can carry credentials or personal data.

// intermediate conversion before this point would be one avoidable
// allocation, immediately copied again into the final line. AnyToBuff also
// handles error values correctly (calls Error() directly), unlike
// Convert(v).String() which returns "" for them — see Panic, whose detail
// can be any value recover() produces, including an error.
